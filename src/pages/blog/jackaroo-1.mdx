## WIP (Est. Completion Feb 2023)
Jackaroo is a board game in popular in the Arabian regions. It its essentially a spinoff of Aggravation and Ludo.

# Rules:

## Game:
The game starts with an empty board, a shuffled deck (52 cards) and 4 players.
Each player places 4 marbles in jail.
Deal cards (4 per player, 5 on last round) and play turns counterclockwise.

## Specials

- (1 / Ace) Three options: Free one marble from jail or move 1 or 11 steps
- (4) Move backwards 4 steps
- (5) Move any marble on the board 5 steps (Excludes marbles other than your own in their home bases)
- (7) Split 7 steps over two of your own marbles. (Includes 7-0 and 0-7)
- (10) Next player discards a card of your choice (Without you looking at the cards) or move ten spaces
- (11) Swap with any other marble on the board. (Excludes own marbles and marbles in their home base)
- (13) Free one marble from jail or move your marble 13 steps and eat all the marbles in path.

- (3)  Move 3 steps
- (6)  Move 6 steps
- (8)  Move 8 steps
- (9)  Move 9 steps
- (12) Move 12 steps

# Problem Definition
There are many algorithms and approaches to design intelligent agents to play games.
In an attempt to narrow the options, Jackaroo is defined as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (PSOG) with properties:

- Partially observable (Can't see other agent's cards)
- Multi-Agent (Co-op AND Competitive) (2v2)
- Stochastic (Card draw)
- Static Environment (Nothing changes while agent is deciding)
- Discrete states (Board has fixed configurations)
- Horizon - Unsure..

Given that this is multi-agent problem, %%%
